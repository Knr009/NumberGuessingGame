# NumberGuessingGame
The Number Guessing Game is a simple console-based Java program where the player attempts to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. The game provides feedback on whether the player's guess is too high or too low. The game continues until the player correctly guesses the number, at which point it displays the number of attempts taken.
